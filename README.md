## To run this 
- Download a local version of this project
- Open the folder and go into the sketch folder, in here you should find another folder 'data' and a sketch file. This sketch file is what you will be running and the
  files that are in 'data' are what will be accessed by the sketch file. 

## Once the Sketch is opened
- Hit the "play" button and it should launch an instance of the program. *note* you may run into a library error for minim if you do not have it installed, if this is the case
  install the library using the tool tab above and proceed with hitting the "play" button.

## Features of The Program
- Each of the "icons" will trigger a hover action displaying either plots, or written blurbs of positivity.
- the "Button" looking icon when clicked will play "1-800-273-8255" a song by Logic about suicide. *fun fact* there is a study out there that suggests this song has helped many
  individuals struggling with their mental health.
